#User has the option --knowledge <arg>, with which can specify the prior knowledge file. Below is the content of a sample prior knowledge file:


/knowledge

addtemporal
1 spending_per_stdt fac_salary stdt_tchr_ratio 
2 rjct_rate stdt_accept_rate 
3 tst_scores stdt_clss_stndng 
4* grad_rate 

forbiddirect
x3 x4

requiredirect
x1 x2



#NOTE 
#The first line of the prior knowledge file must say /knowledge. And a prior knowledge file consists of three sections:
#addtemporal - tiers of variables where the first tier preceeds the last. Adding a asterisk next to the tier id prohibits edges between tier variables
#forbiddirect - forbidden directed edges indicated by a list of pairs of variables: from -> to direction
#requireddirect - required directed edges indicated by a list of pairs of variables: from -> to direction
