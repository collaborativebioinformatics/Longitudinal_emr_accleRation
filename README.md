## Problem: Increased availability of large EHRs with limited accessible causal discovery methods  
With the increasing availability of multimodal patient data, non-specialists, including health care professionals, are obtaining an abundance of transdisciplinary information without a corresponding ability to analyze and interpret it. Traditional statistical methods primarily focus on correlation-based associations, making it difficult to infer causal mechanisms in complex patient trajectories. Working with raw EHR data presents several challenges that must be addressed for effective causal discovery. 
This study presents a computational pipeline that can utilize large EHR datasets, provide approachable user inputs, run more efficient causal analysis, and output more accessible visualizations. We created a causal discovery pipeline for use with the carevue subset of the [MIMIC-III Dataset](https://mimic.mit.edu/ "MIMIC-III Dataset")[Johnson et al., 2022]. Custom R and command line scripts were written and run on [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com "DNAnexus"). Users define parameters of the causal search and our pipeline automates the data preprocessing steps, causal search, and data output visualization.
